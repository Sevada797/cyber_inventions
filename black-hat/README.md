## Info
Here I'll write all kind of techniques, chains, methodologies that can be used by black hat hackers AKA cyber-criminals.

NOTE: Once more, ideas are mine, even tho some of them could exist irl, or already be a known technique, but as this repo description says,
Here I'll write own-inventions even re-inventions.
But don't worry I mostly mention if something is re-invention.

## Warning
I am not responsible for any actions that can be taken by cyber-criminals with this information, I am here to solely express my creativity.
