# XSS Labs

I created these labs as a mix of **real-life cases Iâ€™ve encountered** during my bug hunting journey  
and **original ideas** of mine that didnâ€™t happen in the wild (yet ðŸ‘€),  
but could totally exist in real-world applications.

The goal is to give learners a safe playground to:
- Understand different XSS vectors
- Practice bypassing filters and encodings
- Explore creative payload crafting

> ðŸ’¡ These labs are **for educational and legal testing purposes only**.  
> Donâ€™t try this on systems you donâ€™t have permission to test.

Stay curious, stay safe â€” and happy exploiting! ðŸ˜ˆ
