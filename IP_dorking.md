## Google dorking is cool, but IP dorking ? It's much cooler

Hey guys, I aws google dorking, while I discovered something really really interesting, which is the ```site:``` key in dorking,
I found out it not only accepts TLD or domains like ```site:*.org```, but also it supports IP ranges like,
```site:*.45 intext:It works!```  or intext:Dahua , or intext:Information_schema üíÄÔ∏è (lol with one number, it returned me an old DB no login no pass haha, but of course nothing interesting there, but DB wass open :) 

Anyways, IP dorking, is a technique that I geniuinley believe I invented myself, and I even submited to GHDB, but no response from them ~_~

So you can use these kinda dorks ```site:*.<valid IP block range 0-255> ...``` , and find out interesting things ;D
